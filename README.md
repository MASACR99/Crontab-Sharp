# Simple crontab
Welcome and thanks for choosing this project out of the various implementations! This library is a simple implementation of a crontab string parser, its ~~only~~ job is to receive a string that follows the crontab format (see https://crontab.guru/ for an amazing editor) and return the time in milliseconds to the closest execution.
As of writing of this readme only these [Commands](#commands) are available for use (which should cover most cases to be fair), but still if you have any suggestions for other commands you can open an issue on GitHub and I'll have a look at it.

It also now allows for the execution of your own code using C# timers for a high efficiency, scalable, easy to use and configurable approach (there'll be more configurations coming soonâ„¢)

## Capabilities
What does this project do and not do:

Does:
- Split and parse a crontab format string
- Returns the time in milliseconds to the closest execution time
- Does this very fast

Doesn't:
- ~~Queue code executions~~ It now does as of V2 (reado more [here](#Version-2.0))
- Solve all your problems magically
- Pay for my bills

## Advantages
What advantages does using this implementation over others provide?
Well simple:
- It's a lightweight implementation
- It's fast
- Does not have any external dependencies
- You can use the AddProcess method to create a Timer that will call your methods following the crontab format
- You can decide what to do with the output instead of being locked to a Timer

## Disadvantages
~~Well, due to it being a basic implementation if you need something that already has a timer or has some more advanced features (like automatically executing a method after a certain time) you might be better off using another implementation~~ <- Not true as of [V2](#Version-2.0)

## Commands
Here's the list of the current crontab commands available to use on your strings:
- \* : Allows for all values
- , : Allows for multiple specific values given
- \- : Specifies a range
- / : Specifies the value is divisible by a certain number (example: \*/5, every number divisible by 5, so 0,5,10...)

## How to use
Easy! Just:
- Import the package (either from nuget.org or manually installed) 
- Add the using to your desired class (something like "using Crontab")
- And call Crontab.Crontab.CrontabTimeParser(\<YOUR-STRING-HERE>);

### Version 2.0
As of this version the library can execute your own code following a few parameters:
- CrontabString: The string following the cron format that the execution will follow
- CallAsynchronously: Specifies if the execution of the method given will be synchronous (wait for the process to finish) or asynchronous (not waiting), if it waits, the amount of time the process is running there
will be no more calls to the method, and once it finishes the next execution time will be calculated, if it doesn't wait, it might start multiple instances of your method.

As said before, if you wish for another parameter here, you can open an issue and I'll gladly take a look at it.

In this version there's also a little change to the crontab format, you may now use up to 6 different parameters, in that case the first one will specify the seconds, so you can now run every 30 seconds 
(*/30 * * * * *) for example.

## Roadmap
Currently I'm not expecting to add anything specifically, I'll be waiting to see what bugs you find and what ideas are given to improve the project

## Technical data
Things to keep in mind about the project: 

- Due to the delay between the result of the crontab being given and your implementation using that data your timer might be off by a little bit, to get the most accurate execution try to use the CrontabTimeParser method as close as possible to when you're gonna use that data
- Days of week start as Sunday = 0 because of the DateTime.DayOfWeek enum implementation, that also means that the crontab string has the same format as typical implementations
- If you're gonna use that time to create a C# timer, its max size is 2,147,483,647 or about 25 days, so check the result from the crontab parsing or the Timer will throw an error ;)
- Yes I do understand that my code is not very easy to read or is visually appealing to most, but that's how my brain works so ![Cope](https://c.tenor.com/KvuKMxbmqwAAAAAC/tenor.gif)
